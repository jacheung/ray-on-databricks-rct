## Scaling ML pipelines in Retail, Consumer Goods, and Travel 

Ray is a powerful tool used to scale various parts of the machine learning pipeline to meet production use-cases. This is a repository for use-cases seen across the retail, consumer goods, and travel vertical. For a list of general Ray-on-Databricks examples, see this [repository](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/ray-framework-on-databricks). 


## Examples:
Train lots (e.g. 50k) of forecasting models with Ray Core. 

Tune boosting models (e.g. XGBoost and LightGBM) across large datasets and wide search spaces efficiently using Ray Tune. 

Distributed training for XGboost on large datasets (e.g. 250M rows of data) using Ray Train and Ray Data.
